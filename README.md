Why is this tracker "the most modern"? Because it features a function for reversing the screw, so you don't have to do it manually =) It also has a full opening function.
And it allows you to use Three Point Polar Alignment via NINA with the press of a button. This button will move your tracker by approximately 10 degrees.
